# The Circle
The circle is a project where anybody can make suggestions for what to add next. Every week, I will take up to two suggestions and add them to the circle. the goal is simply to see how wierd the circle gets. This project takes light inspirstion from r/Place, invented by Josh Wardle.
# How it Works
Every week, up to two suggestions will be added to the circle. Make suggestions under the "Issues" tab. Issues will be marked resolved if they are added. even if suggestions aren't added in the first week that they exist, they can still be approved later. Suggestions need to be family friendly. Keep in mind that certain suggestions can't be added.
